<h1>0x16 C - Simple Shell</h1>
<h2>This is a Group Project by Kingsley Dade & Henry Asiedu</h2>
<p>This is a completion of a milestone in the ALX Software engineering program</p>
<p>This is a UNIX Command Interpreter That does the following:</p>
<ul>Executes Commands entered by the user</ul>
<ul>Implements the builtin command <b>cd</b> that changes the current directory of the process.</ul>
<ul>Implements the builtin command <b>pwd</b> that displays the current directory of the process.</ul>
<ul>Implements the builtin command <b>ls</b> that lists the files and directories in the current directory of the process.</ul>
<ul>The prompt should be able to function in both interactive and non-interactive mode</ul>
<ul>Handles Arguments in the other tasks</ul>
<ul>Exits from the shell</ul>
<h2>Compilation</h2>
<p>The shell must be compiled with <b>gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh</b></p>
<p>Run the code with <b>./hsh </b>executable file</p>
